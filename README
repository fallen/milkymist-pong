[> Milkymist Pong Demo
-----------------------

EDIT : This is a port of the pong game to Milkymist One board.
The pong game has originally been written by proppy during a workshop organized by SÃ©bastien Bourdeauducq at /tmp/lab
(French hackerspace).
This pong game was designed to run on the ML501 dev board.
I just ported it to run on the Milkymist One board and to link with latest Milkymist software libraries.

Compile: 

    $ make

Flash on the Milkymist One board: 

    $ make load

Beware, this will replace your BIOS with the Pong game, you will need to restore your BIOS in order to use
Flickernoise to do some VJing afterward.

Following is the original README file: 
The idea here is to present a compo based on the Milkymist hardware platform
within a month. It may be a 2D/3D compo (or 2D only) and must be less than 10min
long.

If you have ideas and/or want to be part of this, there is a small wiki page
at http://www.tmplab.org/wiki/index.php/DemoParty_Compo_with_MilkyMist. Feel

Milkymist is an opensource VJing system-on-chip for FPGA boards,
