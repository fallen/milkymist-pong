. a mod file contains
 . a set of instruments (sample sequences)
 . a set of pattern (how and when instruments are to be played)
 . a list of how and when patterns are to be played

. 4 channels, up to 32 instruments
. samples are stored in the 8 bits pcm format
. patterns are not packed

. pattern format
 . pattern is a set of 64 divisions
 . each division contains data for 4 channels
 . each channel data in the division is 4 bytes
 . is division may be divided into a number of ticks (set speed effect)

	 7654-3210 7654-3210 7654-3210 7654-3210
	 wwww xxxxxxxxxxxxxx yyyy zzzzzzzzzzzzzz

	 where
     	 wwwwyyyy (8 bits) is the sample for this channel/division
	 xxxxxxxxxxxx (12 bits) is the sample's period (or effect parameter)
	 zzzzzzzzzzzz (12 bits) is the effect for this channel/division



/* notes.
   data are stored in the big endian format (mico32 is big).

. samples
 . byte sequence of length given in sample_meta
 . each byte is the channel data, first byte first played
 . first word (ie 16 bits) used to hold the repeat information 

. patterns
 . 64 divisions per pattern
 . each division contains data for each channel
 . channels 1,4 stored on the left, 2,3 on the right
 . channel data is 2 words long (wwwwxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyyyyzzzzzzzzzzzzzz)
  . wy the sample
  . x the sample period or effect param
  . z the channel division effect
 . each divison may be divided into a number of ticks

. pitch of C2 (?) -> 8287 bytes per second


. definitions
 . pitch: the perceived fundamental frequency of a sound. while
 the actual fundamental frequency of a sound can be precisely
 measured, the perceived one may vary because of overtones.
 . overtones: most oscillators vibrates at a serie of distinct
 freqs known as normal modes. the lowest freq is called the
 fundamental freq, while the others are called overtones. thus
 it gives the impression to have other frequencies (overtones)
 when playing one note (fundamental freq).
